Idea Log
========

This directory should be used to document interesting ideas that still need
some thought. Ideas proposed here do not require all semantics to be completely
thoughtout, like specifications do. Ideas accepted here are not guaranteed to a
release. Ideas that are generally accepted should progress to full
specifications and be targeted to a release. Ideas that are no longer
relevant, or end up losing steam, should be pruned from the directory.
