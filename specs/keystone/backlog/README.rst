====================
Backlog Instructions
====================

This directory is for specifications that have been approved but not yet
implemented. Specifications should only be accepted to backlog if they are
fully detailed and ready to be implemented. The only thing preventing a
backlogged specification from being targetted to a release is the absence of an
owner.

Picking up backlogged work
==========================

If you are interested in implementing a backlogged specification, submit a
review request moving it to the appropriate release. The updated review should
reflect the new primary assignee. Please maintain all previous assignees in the
list of Other Contributors. If a specification has been partially implemented,
the document in the backlog will contain information of what has been
completed.
