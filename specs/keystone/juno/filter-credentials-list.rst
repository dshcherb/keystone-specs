Filter credentials by user ID
=============================

`bp filter-credentials-by-user
<https://blueprints.launchpad.net/keystone/+spec/filter-credentials-by-user>`_

Enable control of credentials for users via the Identity policy file


Problem Description
===================

Credentials can be created for users and stored in the Identity service, tagged
with the appropriate ``user_id``. The Identity service policy engine will
already allow a user to have control over their own credentials, for update,
get and delete operations.  However, in order to get a credential you must know
its ID, and the only way to get an ID is to list those credentials tagged with
your ``user_id``.  The only way to control such listing via policy is via
using the policy control of filters - but the list credentials API does not
support a filter on ``user_id``.

Proposed Change
===============

Add a filter of ``user_id`` to the list credentials API.
