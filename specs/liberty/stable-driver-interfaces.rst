Stable Keystone Driver Interfaces
=================================

`bp stable-driver-interfaces
<https://blueprints.launchpad.net/keystone/+spec/stable-driver-interfaces>`_


Keystone has a number of backend drivers that are purportedly able to be
replaced by a developer or deployer with their own implementation (e.g.
utilizing mongodb as a store for Identity information). Currently these
drivers have had significant interface changes each cycle making it difficult
for developers to maintain custom (or subclassed) drivers as each release
has caused a significant delta in all of the Keystone Driver Interface (KSDI)
definitions.

Problem Description
===================

To properly support developers who are implementing drivers for Keystone out
of tree, the Keystone Driver Interface (KSDI) need to be stable like the
REST API is. This specification is to commit to the KSDI for each driver
and ensure that drivers that are written against Liberty will work with
the M-Release of Keystone as well (a minimum of 2-cycle Interface commitment).

Changes to a given KSDI will require compatibility code (to be provided by the
developer that is proposing the change) to ensure that the supported window of
stability is maintained. This means that when a KSDI change is proposed (via
a new KSDI version for the specific subsystem), Keystone will need appropriate
logic to work with both the new version and any currently supported version.

Proposed Change
===============

Each subsystem will have it's driver ABC Base class looked at for a redesign.
Once the KSDI is defined, the driver will be converted over to using the
StrictABC implementation (will not work unless method signatures also match,
not just existence of methods). The KSDI definitions will be versioned and
Keystone will ensure that it can load any version of the KSDI.

Alternatives
------------

Alternatives include "trying" to ensure we don't break the KSDI [best effort]
or continuing with the current way of allowing interfaces to change between
releases. This however, is a sub-optimal experience for deployers and
developers.

Security Impact
---------------

Changes to the KSDI to address Security concerns could become more difficult.
There should be no direct security impact. Each KSDI definition will need to
be reviewed, but this is the same as any change impacting a given driver
interface.

Notifications Impact
--------------------

No notification changes should be needed.

Other End User Impact
---------------------

No changes to end users.

Performance Impact
------------------

No expected performance changes.

Other Deployer Impact
---------------------

Deployers will be able to utilize drivers for more versions of Keystone than
before. However, there should be minimal deployer impact.

Developer Impact
----------------

Developers will need to be aware of how to change the KSDI definitions. This
will include needing to develop the compatibility layer if an KSDI needs to be
changed so previous versions of the driver can be loaded.


Implementation
==============

Assignee(s)
-----------

Primary assignee:

  * gyee (Guang Yee)
  * ajayaa (Ajaya Agrawal)
  * rushiagr (Rushi Agrawal)

Work Items
----------

  * Evaluate and develop the stable KSDI for the following subsystems:

  * Catalog

  * Resource

  * Identity

  * Assignment

  * Assignment.Roles

  * Credential

  * Token Persistence

  * Token Provider

  * Policy

  * Federation

  * OAuth

  * Endpoint Policy

* Convert current drivers to the new KSDI

* Create a separate repo or suite of tests that implements a base (just simple)
  version of the drivers that can be used for validation / loading to ensure
  compatibility / loading works as expected when/if the interface changes.

Dependencies
============

* StrictABC library needs to be finished / used for the driver base-classes.


Documentation Impact
====================

Documentation on how to update the KSDIs and what is expected in compatibility
will be needed. Clear indication of the KSDI definitions will need to be
clearly indicated in our documents.
